# Year 3 report (final year)

_The following project assessment covers the third and final year of our operations. It covers the dates from 10/2022 through 11/2023._

## Brief summary of year 3

In year 3 of 2i2c’s operations, we expanded 2i2c’s operations with several new community partnerships, development partnerships, and grant-funded projects to provide guidance to communities that wish to use open source infrastructure for open science. In addition, we underwent significant organizational changes as the team began to feel strain brought on by our increasing commitments. We spent several months introspecting and identifying where we needed to make improvements to our structure and team capacity, and finished the year by hiring critical new roles. As we head into 2024, 2i2c aims to incorporate these roles into our organization and improve our operational model as a result, we then aim to fundraise for the next phase of 2i2c’s organizational growth.

Notable milestones in several major categories are described and linked below.

#### Notable community partnerships

* We began a partnership with [the US Greenhouse Gas Center](https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/) to run Jupyter infrastructure for their data teams.

We also engaged in several major community initiatives listed below.

**Jupyter-specific conversations and open source engagement/leadership…**

* We released [a blog post on Principles for contributing to Open Source](https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/open-source-funding-principles/) and encoded this in our [Open Source Strategy section of 2i2c’s team compass](https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/).
* Our engineer Georgiana Dolocan [published a blog post about her professional journey from Outreachy intern to 2i2c engineer](https://blog.jupyter.org/from-intern-to-mentor-6055df406999?source=collection_home---6------1-----------------------) on the Jupyter blog.

    * We partnered with The Turing Institute on a [second phase of JupyterHub’s Community Strategic Lead work](https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/709), which we will begin later this year.
* We piloted a new form of meeting with the JupyterHub team [called the Collaboration Cafe](https://blog.jupyter.org/online-collaboration-caf%C3%A9-launch-jupyterhub-team-meetings-to-become-more-collaborative-spaces-b713edadf15?source=rss----95916e268740--jupyterhub)

* We expanded the [Executable Books steering council](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/blog/2023/new-project-members/) and led efforts to incorporate many of the project’s repositories into the Jupyter project.

### Enabling the execution of projects and collaborations for Jupyter in research and education

_We did not focus on this goal in the final year of the grant, because we had team capacity from other funds to lead these efforts._

* We [created a new role to help improve 2i2c’s system of delivery and planning](https://compass.2i2c.org/engineering/roles/delivery-manager/). This role will lead efforts around this goal in the future.
